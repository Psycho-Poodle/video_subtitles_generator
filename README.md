## **Hugging Face Deployment**
The project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. However, due to cookie restrictions, YouTube links may not work in the Hugging Face environment. To use YouTube links, clone the repository and run the project locally.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Input Handling**: Accepts a video file or YouTube URL.
2. **Audio Extraction**: Extracts audio from the video using `moviepy`.
3. **Transcription**: Transcribes the audio using AssemblyAI's API.
4. **Subtitle Addition**: Adds subtitles to the video using FFmpeg.
5. **Output**: Returns the video with embedded subtitles.

---

## **Customization**
You can customize the subtitle style by modifying the `add_subtitles` function in `app.py`. For example:
```python
force_style='Fontname=Arial,Fontsize=30,PrimaryColour=&HFFFFFF,OutlineColour=&H000000,BorderStyle=3,Outline=1'
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**
- **YouTube Links Not Working on Hugging Face**: This is due to cookie restrictions. Run the project locally to use YouTube links.
- **FFmpeg Errors**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
- **AssemblyAI API Errors**: Verify that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
